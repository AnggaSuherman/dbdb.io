Creating a database currently doesn't work through the website, so once the server is run (hopefully no errors) one will have to be created through the databse. Couldn't create one quite easily because of all the fields necessary and the foreign keys. First make a system (choose an easy secret key like 1234), then make a system version pointing to that system.

Try making changes to the db version by using the secret key. Saving isn't working yet but you can see how the entries are updated through django admin. Some things aren't being updated correctly yet so you may have to set them manually.
